## What is Cyberspace?

- **Cyberspace** refers to anything involving computers and communication networks.
- It includes:
  - Phones
  - Smart TVs
  - The internet
  - Data centers
  - Embedded devices (like in cars or watches)
- 🧠 It's *not a physical place*, but a network of **devices**, **data**, and **connections**.

## ⚠️ Why is Cybersecurity Important?

1. **Dependence on Technology**  
   Everything from:
   - Banks managing money  
   - Hospitals running machines  
   - Governments controlling defense systems  
   - Amazon delivering packages  
   ...depends on tech. Any failure or attack can cause *major or life-threatening* disruptions.

2. **Cyber Threats Are Real**  
   - Hackers, criminals, terrorists, and foreign governments:
     - Steal sensitive data  
     - Wipe out critical systems  
     - Spy on citizens  
     - Disrupt services like power or transport

## 🛠️ What is Cybersecurity?

- Cybersecurity is about:
  - Technologies
  - Policies
  - Practices  
...that protect your data and systems from **threat actors**.

### Who are threat actors?
> Bad guys who may steal data, damage systems, or use your computer without your knowledge.

## ❓ Can Cybersecurity Problems Be Solved?

- Like crime or war, they can't be fully eliminated.
- We can only:
  - Reduce it
  - Manage it
  - Prepare for it
- Cybersecurity is a **continuous process**, not a one-time fix.

## 🧠 Why Aren’t We Secure Yet?

1. **We don’t even use all the known security measures.**
2. **We need new tools, knowledge, and better public policies.**

---

## 🏛️ Public Policy and Cybersecurity

Governments must:
- Make laws
- Set priorities
- Support cybersecurity research
- Help people and companies stay secure

BUT... this is hard because of the need to balance:
- 🧪 Innovation  
- 🔓 Freedom  
- 🔑 Convenience  
- 🔒 Privacy  
- 🚫 Not banning useful technologies

---

## 🕵️ Offensive Cyber Operations

- Some countries (like the US) have **cyber armies**.
- They use offensive tools (e.g., viruses, hacks) for **national defense**.
- Most of this is **secret**, which:
- Makes it hard to have public discussions
- Raises ethical concerns about cyber warfare
