# 🛡️ Module 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity

---
## Lesson 1: Introduction
## 🌐 What is "Cyber"?

- **Cyber** involves anything related to computers or communication networks.
- It blends **technology** with **humans** and **organizations**.

### 🔎 Definition of "Cyber"
> "The electronic world created by interconnected networks of information technology and the information on those networks. It is a *global commons* where people are linked together to exchange ideas, services, and friendships."

---

## 🔐 What is "Security"?

- **Security** = Freedom from fear or danger.

---

## 🧩 Definition of "Cybersecurity"

> *Cybersecurity* is the organization and collection of **resources**, **processes**, and **structures** used to protect **cyberspace** and cyberspace-enabled systems.

---

## What is Cyberspace?

- **Cyberspace** refers to anything involving computers and communication networks.
- It includes:
  - Phones
  - Smart TVs
  - The internet
  - Data centers
  - Embedded devices (like in cars or watches)
- 🧠 It's *not a physical place*, but a network of **devices**, **data**, and **connections**.

---

## ⚠️ Why is Cybersecurity Important?

1. **Dependence on Technology**  
   Everything from:
   - Banks managing money  
   - Hospitals running machines  
   - Governments controlling defense systems  
   - Amazon delivering packages  
   ...depends on tech. Any failure or attack can cause *major or life-threatening* disruptions.

2. **Cyber Threats Are Real**  
   - Hackers, criminals, terrorists, and foreign governments:
     - Steal sensitive data  
     - Wipe out critical systems  
     - Spy on citizens  
     - Disrupt services like power or transport

---

## 🛠️ What is Cybersecurity?

- Cybersecurity is about:
  - Technologies
  - Policies
  - Practices  
...that protect your data and systems from **threat actors**.

### Who are threat actors?
> Bad guys who may steal data, damage systems, or use your computer without your knowledge.

---

## ❓ Can Cybersecurity Problems Be Solved?

- Like crime or war, they can't be fully eliminated.
- We can only:
  - Reduce it
  - Manage it
  - Prepare for it
- Cybersecurity is a **continuous process**, not a one-time fix.

---

## 🧠 Why Aren’t We Secure Yet?

1. **We don’t even use all the known security measures.**
2. **We need new tools, knowledge, and better public policies.**

---

## 🏛️ Public Policy and Cybersecurity

Governments must:
- Make laws
- Set priorities
- Support cybersecurity research
- Help people and companies stay secure

BUT... this is hard because of the need to balance:
- 🧪 Innovation  
- 🔓 Freedom  
- 🔑 Convenience  
- 🔒 Privacy  
- 🚫 Not banning useful technologies

---

## 🕵️ Offensive Cyber Operations

- Some countries (like the US) have **cyber armies**.
- They use offensive tools (e.g., viruses, hacks) for **national defense**.
- Most of this is **secret**, which:
- Makes it hard to have public discussions
- Raises ethical concerns about cyber warfare

---
## Lesson 2: What is Computing Technology?

### 💻 What’s a Computer, Really?

- A **computer** is made up of:
  - A **brain** (processor)
  - A **memory** (storage)
  - Interfaces to **interact** with the world (input/output)
- It **takes input**, **processes it** using programs, and **produces output**.
- **Cybersecurity** at this level means protecting these core parts:
  - Preventing **viruses**
  - Blocking **unauthorized access**
  - Avoiding **system failures**

---

### 🌐 How Does Communication Happen?

- The **Internet** is like a **huge postal system**.
- Messages get **broken into small packets**, travel across **various routes**, and are **reassembled at the destination**.
- All of this happens in **milliseconds**.

---

### 🔗 Networks and Protocols

- A **network** is a group of connected computers.
- They communicate using **protocols** (rules).
- The most important protocols:
  - **IP (Internet Protocol)** – provides an address for each device.
  - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** – ensures all packets arrive correctly and in order.

---

### 🔒 Cybersecurity & Packets

- **Hackers** can:
  - Intercept packets
  - Modify data during travel
  - Pretend to be someone else (**spoofing**)
- **Cybersecurity tools** used to protect data:
  - **Encryption**
  - **Firewalls**

---

### 🏥 What is an IT System?

- An **IT system** = many **computers, software, networks, and people** working together for a purpose.
- Examples:
  - **Hospitals** – patient records
  - **Airlines** – flight & booking systems
  - **Governments** – taxes, defense, public services

### 🧩 Components of an IT System include **Hardware**, **Software** **Networks**, **Data**, **People**

---

## Lesson 3: Understanding Cyber Threats

---

### Who are the adversaries in cyberspace?

An **adversary** is anyone who wants to cause harm using cyberspace. Common types include:

- **Hackers** – Skilled coders or pranksters.
- **Cybercriminals** – Motivated by money.
- **Terrorists** – Aim to create fear, chaos, or destruction.
- **State Actors** – Countries spying or attacking each other.
- **Insiders** – Trusted individuals abusing internal access.

---

### Types of Cyber Threats

1. **Cyber Exploitation**
   - **Goal:** Steal information or spy quietly without being detected.
   - **Example:** A hacker secretly steals your company's product plans.

2. **Cyber Attack**
   - **Goal:** Break, damage, or disrupt systems.
   - **Example:** Crashing hospital systems.

---

### Why IT is Naturally Vulnerable

Even the best systems have weaknesses:

- Poorly written software code.
- Weak or reused passwords.
- Unsecured devices (e.g., outdated routers, IoT gadgets).
- Human errors (e.g., clicking scam/phishing links).

---

### Anatomy of a Cyber Attack

1. **Penetration**
   - Attacker gains entry (e.g., phishing, weak password).
   
2. **Payload or Malware**
   - Malicious software is installed, such as:
     - **Virus:** Spreads and destroys files.
     - **Ransomware:** Locks files and demands payment.
     - **Spyware:** Watches and records user activity.

3. **Operations**
   - Attacker steals data, disables systems, or stays hidden waiting to strike.

---

### Common Threats in the Real World

| **Threat Type**         | **What It Does**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Phishing**            | Tricks users into revealing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, OTPs).      |
| **Denial of Service**   | Floods a server/website to crash or slow it down.                               |
| **Man-in-the-Middle**   | Eavesdrops or alters communication between two parties.                         |
| **Zero-Day Exploit**    | Uses a vulnerability that is unknown to developers – no patch exists yet.       |
| **Botnets**             | A network of infected computers controlled by a hacker to launch bigger attacks.|

---

### How Do We Assess Threats?

Cybersecurity experts evaluate threats by asking:

- **Who** might attack?
- **Why** would they attack?
- **What** are they targeting?
- **How** easy or hard is it to defend?

---


## 📘 LESSON 4: How to improve cybersecurity

### 🔧 Technical ways to improve cybersecurity

1. **Reduce dependency on IT**  
   → Not everything needs to be online  
   → Eg. Use physical backups or manual controls for critical systems (like hospital equipment).  

2. **Know when you've been hacked**  
   → Many don't even realize they're compromised  
   → Solution: Intrusion detection systems (IDS) alert you when something suspicious happens  

3. **Defend the system**  
   → Use firewalls, anti-malware, regular updates, and network segmentation  
   → Just like locking every room in your house instead of only the front door  

4. **Ensure accountability**  
   → Keep logs to trace who did what and when  
   → If users know actions are tracked, they behave better  

5. **Be Resilient: Contain and Recover**  
   → Prepare for the worst, restore backups, disaster recovery for your data and software  
   → Like having a fire drill for your data  

6. **Use 'attack back'**  
   → Eg. Honeypots (lure hackers into fake systems)  
   → Some even strike back, but this is legally risky and controversial  

---

### 🌐 Non-Technical Dimensions of Cybersecurity

1. **Economics**  
   → Some don't secure because security is expensive  
   → Eg. A company may not invest in protection while a breach costs them more  

2. **Psychology**  
   → Many attacks succeed because users are tricked  
   → Eg. Click on a fake prize email  
   → Training users and simplifying security can prevent many attacks  

3. **Law**  
   → Cyber law help punish criminals and set groundrules  
   → But laws struggle to keep up with new tech and international issues  

4. **Organizational structures**  
   → Some companies have no clear responsibility for cybersecurity  
   → Security must be part of the culture, not just an afterthought  

5. **Deterrence**  
   → Make it costly and risky to attack you  
   → Warning, alert, that might face prosecution if caught  

---
## How do we measure cybersecurity

→ Use risk assessment: What are the most likely threats?  
→ Set security benchmarks: Are all systems updated and protected?  
→ Track response time: How fast can you detect and contain an incident?

## Why we need research

Because  
→ Attackers are getting smarter.  
→ Tech is getting more complex  
   → We need new tools, but also better human behavior models, economic strategies, and laws.

## Security ≠ Trust technology

Even the best tools can fail if:  
→ People use “password123”  
→ Companies ignore warnings  
→ Or no one knows what to do in an emergency.

**That's why cybersecurity must be holistic – a mix of:**
- Tech tools
- Smart policy
- Trained people
- And constant improvement

### 📚 LESSON 5: The tension between cybersecurity and other public goals

Cybersecurity is essential – but it often clashes with other things in society like:

- Privacy  
- Civil rights  
- Innovation  
- International trust

---

### ⚖️ Cybersecurity vs Economics

Using economics to improve cybersecurity:

- If hacking costs more than the reward, it discourages attackers  
- Insurance, fines and incentives can push companies to secure better  
- But often, security feels like a cost, not a benefit – so it’s neglected

---

### 💣 Cost of cyber attacks

Cyberattacks can:

- Crash stock markets  
- Halt hospitals  
- Leak confidential business data

Still, many companies **don’t improve security unless they experience a loss themselves.**
